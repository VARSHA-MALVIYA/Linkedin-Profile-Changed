This is the chrome extension which changes the LinkedIn Profile Photos of feed posts of a user with the photo given by User.

- I additionally extended the extension to work with the commented profile photos as well.
- I know that there are some classes in the code used for query selecting which makes the code very clumsy, but its what required.
- I have made a basic working of it, I can also decorate the extension.
- I have taken some help of ChatGPT, to know how to fetch the image link, given by User, because I dont know this thing, But rest I know and made it by my own.
- Waiting for your positive reply, LGTM team.
